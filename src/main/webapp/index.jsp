<h3>Welcome to The Role Security Home Page</h3>
<p>Our web site does have security and it includes security by ROLE, so NOT everyone
who is logged in can visit all our pages.</p>
<p>If you haven't <a href='login.jsp'>logged in</a> you cannot visit the <a href='secure/index.jsp'>pages in the secure area</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't logged in yet or if you've logged in but don't have the 
admin role, you most cannot see our <a href='GetAllUsers'> secret users list.</a></p>
<p>If you are logged in you can view the above pages.  You should <a href='LogoutUser'>log out</a> when 
you're finished.</p>
